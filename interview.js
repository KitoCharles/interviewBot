You can't feel, see or in any other way find out which side is up. Split the coins into two piles such that there are the same number of heads in each pile.",           
            "answer":"Place 50 coins into two piles on its edges so that both have the same amount of heads in each pile, neither facing up or down. Answer #2: Trick question, place 50 coins in both piles and in theory they all have heads just not necessarily facing up or down.",

            "answer":"Interface programming is contract based. Object-oriented is a way to write granular objects which have a single purpose. Aspect oriented programming is to segregate the code in such a manner that various objects carry the main tasks, and the subsidiary tasks are carried by independent objects.",

            "answer":"The basic difference of BS2 and BS3 engines is the presence of a catalytic convertor. The catalytic convertor is present in the BS3 engine which helps in reducing the formation of HC and CO. While in BS2 engine, no catalytic convertor is present which forms HC and CO. Thus in BS3 engine there is no emission of harmful CO and HC. The full form of BS is bharat stage, which is a standard of emission in India.",

            "answer":"This system is based on Pascal’s law. In a tractor the pressure is same, so the force given by the liquid to the surrounding is equal to the pressure X area. Thus, obeying the Pascal’s law hydrostatic propulsion system is designed, similarly small piston feels small force and the large piston feels larger area.",
