            "question": "You have 100 coins laying flat on a table, each with a head side and a tail side. 10 of them are heads up, 90 are tails up. You can't feel, see or in any other way find out which side is up. Split the coins into two piles such that there are the same number of heads in each pile. How would you solve this?",
            "answer": "Trick question. Place 50 coins in both piles and in theory they all have heads just not necessarily facing up or down.",

            "answer": "Interface programming is contract based. Object-oriented is a way to write granular objects which have a single purpose. Aspect oriented programming is to segregate the code in such a manner that various objects carry the main tasks, and the subsidiary tasks are carried by independent objects.",

            "question": "Explain the basic difference between Bs2 And Bs3 engine.",
            "answer": "The basic difference of BS2 and BS3 engines is the presence of a catalytic convertor. The catalytic convertor is present in the BS3 engine which helps in reducing the formation of HC and CO. While in BS2 engine, no catalytic convertor is present which forms HC and CO. Thus in BS3 engine there is no emission of harmful CO and HC. The full form of BS is bharat stage, which is a standard of emission in India.",

            "question": "In a tractor, explain how the hydrostatic propulsion systems work?",
            "answer": "This system is based on Pascal’s law. In a tractor the pressure is same, so the force given by the liquid to the surrounding is equal to the pressure X area. Thus, obeying the Pascal’s law hydrostatic propulsion system is designed, similarly small piston feels small force and the large piston feels larger area.",

Check whether car emits blue gray, dense smoke or a normal smoke from exhaust pipe. Watch out for engine noises, any vibrations, lack of power or any other issues. Check for any burning smells when open the hood. Check steering wheel, driver’s seat and inner door. Check tires ( Edge should not worn out, no bulge on the sidewall, no cuts, enough groves to hold the road). Check all meter work fine when you start the car",

            "question": "Explain how timing belt works?",
            "answer": "Timing belt rests on the crankshaft pulley and either one or two camshaft pulley; they are all align through timing belt. The closing and opening of engine valves are controlled by camshaft to let in air and fuel mixture or exhaust gas, if you do not have a timing belt or damaged timing,  it will directly affect the timing of opening and closing of engine valves. This is the reason it is called timing belt and if not in a good position, it will damage your engine.",
